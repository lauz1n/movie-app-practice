# Movie App

# This Movie App was built with ReactJS and API Rest

## In this project I practiced my ReactJS and API Rest abilities, below is a list of the tools I used to do it.

### useState Hook
- The useState hook is used to manage the State of the Component. By passing the initial state, you get in return a variable with the current state and a special function to update the state whenever you add a change to it.

### useEffect Hook
- The useEffect hook is often used when you need to perform side effects in your documents, like for example data fetching. The useEffect takes place whenever you render.

### Properties (props)
- This is one of my favourite parts about React, props makes it so that you can pass data from one component to another by simply passing it as an argument in your Component function.
